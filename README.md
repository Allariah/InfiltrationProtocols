# Infiltration Protocols
A Repository for a collection of rules adjustments for the Boarding Actions Variant of Warhammer 40K 10th Edition.

The goal of these changes is to enable a more cohesive list building experience not restricted to the mustering rules detailed by the design team.

The core tenets being to:
- Enable the use of more Epic Heroes across available factions
- Attempt to calculate a better 'average' point limit for games to encourage more varied lists. This may be achieved through game simulation or mathhammer.
- Provide Example and Thematic 'Starter Lists' for players to aim for when building their factions if they are new to the game
